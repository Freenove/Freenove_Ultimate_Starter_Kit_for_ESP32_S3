Chapter Play SD card music
##############################################################################

In the previous study, we have learned how to use the SD card, and then we will learn to play the music in the SD card.

Project SDMMC Music
******************************

In this project, we will read an mp3 file from an SD card, decode it through ESP32-S3, and use a speaker to play it.

How to install the library
-----------------------------

In this project, we will use the ESP8266Audio.zip library to decode the audio files in the SD card, and then output the audio signal through GPIO. If you have not installed this library, please follow the steps below to install it.

Open arduino -> Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP Library. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/29_Play_SD_card_music/Chapter29_05.png
    :align: center

In the new pop-up window, select " **Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32_S3\\C\\Libraries\\ESP8266Audio.zip** ". Then click "Open".

Sketch_PlayMP3FromSD
------------------------------------

We placed a folder called "music" in:

**Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32_S3\\Sketches\\Sketch_29.1_PlayMP3FromSD**

User needs to copy this folder to SD card.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/29_Play_SD_card_music/Chapter29_07.png
    :align: center

Click upload.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/29_Play_SD_card_music/Chapter29_08.png
    :align: center

Compile and upload the code to the ESP32-S3 WROOM and open the serial monitor. ESP32-S3 takes a few seconds to initialize the program. When you see the message below, it means that ESP32-S3 has started parsing the mp3 in sd and started playing music through Pin.
