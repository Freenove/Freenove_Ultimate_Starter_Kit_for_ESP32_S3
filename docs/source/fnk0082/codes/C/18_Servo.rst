Previously, we learned how to control the speed and rotational direction of a motor. In this chapter, we will learn about servos which are a rotary actuator type motor that can be controlled to rotate to specific angles.

Project Servo Sweep

First, we need to learn how to make a servo rotate.

Component knowledge
==========================

Servo
--------------------------

Servo is a compact package which consists of a DC motor, a set of reduction gears to provide torque, a sensor and control circuit board. Most servos only have a 180-degree range of motion via their "horn". Servos can output higher torque than a simple DC motor alone and they are widely used to control motion in model cars, model airplanes, robots, etc. Servos have three wire leads which usually terminate to a male or female 3-pin plug. Two leads are for electric power: positive (2-VCC, Red wire), negative (3-GND, Brown wire), and the signal line (1-Signal, Orange wire), as represented in the Servo provided in your Kit.

    :align: center

We will use a 50Hz PWM signal with a duty cycle in a certain range to drive the Servo. The lasting time of 0.5ms-2.5ms of PWM single cycle high level corresponds to the servo angle 0 degrees - 180 degree linearly. Part of the corresponding values are as follows:

+-----------------+-------------+
| High level time | Servo angle |
+=================+=============+
| 0.5ms           | 0 degree    |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 1ms             | 45 degree   |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 1.5ms           | 0 degree    |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 2ms             | 45 degree   |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 2.5ms           | 180 degree  |
+-----------------+-------------+

When you change the servo signal value, the servo will rotate to the designated angle.

Circuit
==========================

Use caution when supplying power to the servo, it should be 5V. Make sure you do not make any errors when connecting the servo to the power supply.
